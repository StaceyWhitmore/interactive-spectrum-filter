Interactive Spectrum Filter
============================
An algorithm which takes a sample of music, extracting 1/2 second segments where the pitch is constant. It then computes and plots a spectrogram of those segments. The program includes functions for high and low-pass filters which can be used to filter out harmonics when needed.

### Freesound

Special thanks to Freesound (http://freesound.org), which is the source of many of the
sound samples I use in this project, and to the Freesound users who
uploaded those sounds.  I may  some of their wave files in
the GitHub repository for this project, using the original file
names, so it should be easy to find their sources.

Unfortunately, most Freesound users don't make their real names
available, so I can only thank them using their user names.  Samples
used in this project  were contributed by Freesound users: iluppai,
wcfl10, thirsk, docquesting, kleeb, landup, zippi1, themusicalnomad,
bcjordan, rockwehrmann, marchascon7, jcveliz.  Thank you all!
